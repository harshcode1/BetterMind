## 📖 Overview

**BetterMind** is a full-stack mental health platform built with the Next.js App Router. It brings together the day-to-day tools people actually need for mental wellness — **daily mood logging**, **clinically-validated assessments (PHQ-9 & GAD-7)**, an **AI chat companion**, and **appointment booking with verified mental-health professionals** — behind a single, calming, accessibility-minded interface.

It supports three distinct roles (**patient**, **doctor**, **admin**), each with its own dashboard and permissions, all secured by a custom JWT auth layer with optional **TOTP two-factor authentication**, **AES-encrypted sensitive data**, and **rate-limited APIs**.

> 💡 **For recruiters:** you can explore the entire product — every page, populated with realistic data — **without creating an account**. See [Guest Mode](#-guest-mode-no-sign-up-required).

---

## 🎭 Guest Mode (no sign-up required)

Click **“Explore as Guest”** on the landing or login page to instantly browse the full platform with realistic demo data — mood trends, assessment history, AI conversations, doctor listings, and appointments. The moment a guest tries to *write* data (save a mood, book an appointment, message the AI), a friendly modal invites them to create an account — so the experience is fully explorable but nothing leaks into the database.

This was built specifically so the product can be **demoed end-to-end in seconds**, with no friction, while keeping real data writes safely behind authentication.

```

**Key design decisions**
- **Custom JWT auth** (httpOnly cookie) over a heavier auth framework — full control over the 2FA challenge flow and role gating.
- **Server-side auth verification with a short-lived in-memory cache** to avoid hammering the DB on every request.
- **Graceful degradation** everywhere: AI chat falls back to keyword matching without an API key; Calendar sync no-ops without OAuth tokens; the app boots even if optional env vars are missing.
- **Guest mode as a first-class client concern** — demo data lives entirely client-side and write actions are intercepted by a single `requireRealUser()` gate.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|---|---|
| **Framework** | Next.js 14 (App Router, Route Handlers, Server/Client Components) |
| **UI** | React 18, Tailwind CSS 3, custom design-token system |
| **Animation** | Framer Motion 12 (layout animations, `AnimatePresence`, shared-layout nav) |
| **Data Viz** | Recharts 3 (area, line, bar, scatter charts) |
| **Database** | MongoDB 6 (official driver) |
| **Auth** | JWT (`jsonwebtoken`), httpOnly cookies, `bcryptjs`, **otplib** TOTP 2FA, `qrcode` |
| **AI** | OpenAI SDK (`gpt-4o-mini`) with context injection + keyword fallback |
| **Integrations** | Google APIs (`googleapis`) — Calendar sync via OAuth |
| **Security** | AES encryption for sensitive fields, in-memory rate limiting, role-based access control |
| **Icons** | lucide-react |

---

## 🔒 Security

- **JWT authentication** stored in httpOnly cookies, verified server-side on every protected route.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)** — full enable/verify/disable flow with QR provisioning and one-time recovery codes; JWT issuance is gated on the 2FA challenge at login.
- **AES encryption** for sensitive data at rest.
- **Rate limiting** — login, registration (5/15min), chat (30/min), and assessments (20/hr) are throttled via a reusable limiter factory.
- **Role-based access control** — patient / doctor / admin separation enforced both client- and server-side.
- **Doctor verification** — professionals cannot accept appointments until an admin approves their credentials.

## 💼 Resume / Portfolio Highlights

> Copy-paste-ready bullets describing what this project demonstrates.

- Built a **full-stack mental health platform** with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **React 18**, **MongoDB**, and **Tailwind CSS**, supporting three role-based experiences (patient, doctor, admin).

- Integrated **OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`** into an AI mental-health companion, **injecting the user's recent mood and clinical-assessment data as context** for personalized, safety-aware responses, with a graceful keyword-based fallback.
- Implemented **clinically-validated PHQ-9 & GAD-7 assessments** with automated severity scoring, historical trend visualization, and a question-by-question breakdown.
- Designed an **interactive analytics dashboard** with **Recharts** — mood trends, assessment trends, activity-impact analysis, and a **Pearson correlation** between mood and symptom severity.
- Built **doctor discovery & appointment booking** with availability slots, **Google Calendar OAuth sync**, ratings/reviews, and an **admin verification workflow**.
- Added **API rate limiting**, **AES encryption** for sensitive data, and **role-based access control** across the stack.
- Led a complete **UI/UX redesign** from a dark theme to a research-backed **calming light design system** (color psychology for mental health), built on Tailwind design tokens and Framer Motion micro-interactions.
- Shipped a **“Guest Mode”** that lets anyone explore the full product with realistic demo data while keeping all writes safely behind auth — purpose-built for frictionless demos.
